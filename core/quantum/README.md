# ⚛️ Quantum Core - Reality Engine

> "In quantum mechanics, reality doesn't exist until it's observed. In GOLEM, responses don't exist until they're needed." - Quantum Philosophy

## 🌌 Overview

The Quantum Core is the fundamental processing engine of GOLEM. It treats every interaction as a quantum superposition of possibilities that collapse into the optimal response.

## 🔬 Core Concepts

### 1. Quantum Superposition
Every input exists in multiple potential states simultaneously:
```python
signal = Signal(source=message, intent="unknown")
# Signal now exists in superposition of all possible intents
```

### 2. Observer Pattern
Multiple observers examine the signal and propose realities:
```python
class CommandObserver(QuantumObserver):
    async def observe(self, state, signal):
        if self.can_handle(signal):
            return Response(content=result, confidence=0.95)
```

### 3. Wave Function Collapse
The highest confidence reality manifests:
```python
response = await quantum_core.receive(signal)
# All possibilities evaluated in parallel
# Best response selected based on confidence × relevance
```

## 🎯 Key Components

### QuantumCore
The main processing engine:
- Manages quantum state
- Coordinates observers
- Collapses possibilities
- Tracks performance

### Signal
Quantum representation of input:
- Source (message, interaction, event)
- Intent (derived or explicit)
- Context (rich metadata)
- Energy (importance weight)

### Response
Collapsed reality output:
- Content (the actual response)
- Confidence (0.0 - 1.0)
- Side effects (async actions)
- Metadata (for learning)

### QuantumObserver
Base class for reality proposers:
- `can_observe()` - Determines relevance
- `observe()` - Proposes a reality

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from core.quantum import QuantumCore, Signal

core = QuantumCore()
signal = Signal(source="Hello", intent="greeting")
response = await core.receive(signal)
```

### Adding Observers
```python
from core.quantum import QuantumObserver

class GreetingObserver(QuantumObserver):
    def can_observe(self, signal):
        return signal.intent == "greeting"
    
    async def observe(self, state, signal):
        return Response(
            content="Quantum greetings!",
            confidence=0.9
        )

core.add_observer(GreetingObserver())
```

## 📊 Quantum Metrics

The quantum core tracks its own coherence:
```python
health = core.health
# {
#     'state': 'coherent',
#     'observers': 5,
#     'avg_response_time': 0.003,
#     'quantum_coherence': 0.99
# }
```

## 🧬 Advanced Features

### Entanglement
Connect quantum states across systems:
```python
core.entangle('user_preference', preference_data)
# Now all observers can access entangled data
```

### Quantum Tunneling
Skip processing for known patterns:
```python
# Future: Responses tunnel through quantum barrier
# for instantaneous results
```

### Superposition Caching
Cache multiple potential responses:
```python
# Future: Keep top N possibilities ready
# Collapse instantly when needed
```

## 🔮 Quantum Philosophy

1. **Reality is Probabilistic** - Multiple valid responses exist
2. **Observation Creates Reality** - The act of processing creates the response
3. **Performance Affects Coherence** - Faster responses maintain better quantum state
4. **Entanglement Enables Intelligence** - Connected states share information

## 🎨 Creating Custom Observers

```python
class CustomObserver(QuantumObserver):
    def __init__(self):
        self.patterns = self.load_patterns()
    
    def can_observe(self, signal):
        # Determine if this observer is relevant
        return any(p.matches(signal) for p in self.patterns)
    
    async def observe(self, state, signal):
        # Propose a reality
        result = await self.process(signal)
        confidence = self.calculate_confidence(result)
        
        return Response(
            content=result,
            confidence=confidence,
            metadata={'observer': 'custom'}
        )
```

## 🌟 The Quantum Advantage

Traditional bots process sequentially. GOLEM evaluates all possibilities simultaneously:

**Traditional:**
```
Input → Parse → Route → Process → Response
        ↓ (fail)
      Error
```

**Quantum:**
```
Input → [Observer1] [Observer2] [Observer3] → Best Response
         ↓          ↓          ↓
      Reality1   Reality2   Reality3
```

## 🧭 For AI Navigators

When working with the Quantum Core:
1. Think in probabilities, not certainties
2. Add observers for new capabilities
3. Let confidence determine reality
4. Monitor quantum coherence for health

Remember: In the quantum realm, all possibilities exist until one is needed.
